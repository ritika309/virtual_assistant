individual based on verbal commands. Moreover this virtual
assistant shall use verbal inputs for analysing emotion of the
speaker, adding a psychological value to this assistant.The design
includes a feature that advises the users based on their mood
detected using speech emotion recognition.
The model extracts various audio features using Librosa
python library. Using deep learning algorithm of Convolutional
Neural Networks, Scikit-learnâ€™s Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier.
